**Brothers in Arms Mods** is a collaborative effort by the members of <a href="https//armaforces.com/">ArmaForces</a>, polish Arma 3 community.

Main purpose of this addon is to bend and adjust Arma 3 game features to the Group gameplay needs and style.

The mod is on the same foundation as the ACE3 mod, using its framework, systems, tools and standards. It is entirely **open-source** and licensed under the GNU General Public License ([GPLv2](https://github.com/ArmaForces/Mods/blob/master/LICENSE)).
